<h1 align="center"> AudioCaps Demo page </h1> 



## 🚀 Quick start

1. **Start developing.**

    ```sh
    cd audiocaps.github.io
    git checkout code
    gatsby develop
    ```

    *Note*: Edit your code in `code` branch .  `master` branch is reserved to serve static pages.

2. **Open the source code and start editing**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`! 

    Save your changes and the browser will update in real time.

3.  **Deploy**

    ```sh
    yarn deploy
    ```

    Build result is pushed to `master` branch in your remote git repo.

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see. You usually want to change **`boldface`** files.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── src
        ├── audios
        ├── components
        		 ├── supp
        ├── pages
            ├── index.js
            ├── supp.js
        ├── videos
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── gatsby-config.js
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/src`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. 
    1.  `audios` : currently not used.
    2.  **`components`** : This directory contains all necessary components used in `pages`
    3.  **`pages`** 
        1.  `index.js`, `index.scss` : index page
        2.  `supp.js`, `supp.scss` : supplementary page
    4.  **`videos`**
2.  **`package.json`**: This file includes metadata (the project’s name, author, etc) and which packages to install for your project.
3.  `gatsby-config.js`: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

### Auto-generated files

1. `/node_modules`: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.
2. `package-lock.json` This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**
